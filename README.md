Swift tiny features
===================
## Introduce
Hi, I am Donny Ho,

This is my Swift projects for practising animation, inspired by [Allen Wang](https://twitter.com/creativewang) [30 days of Swift](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift), I started to following on him, and made these projects. Plus other subjects of Swift, I'v spent nearly six months from a total beginner. And when you believe "Practice make perfect." thing, then nothing would ever defeat you. Hoping people like me as a beginner will make a good step to do these things seem impossible.
